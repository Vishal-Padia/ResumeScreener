and scheduler \na tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through availability grid and\ntutor submits availability \na scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring \nalso  there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project \nthe other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day \nresponsibilities  created a availability calendar grid \nin grid each cell represents time  1 hour
