although i was only there for\na short period of time  the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that i had been missing in my culinary experience  it also\nposed a challenge for me since i have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years  the 5 spot was a highly fast paced\nneighborhood kitchen  so  you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must  i really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to\nstart all over from the bottom and work my way back up  i ended up leaving the 5 spot due to constant management changes and an

have been employed by sushi time for six years where i started at the very bottom\nand worked my way to the top  i have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers  helping them to their seats \ngrabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face  i worked as a host server for\nabout a year  so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi  in order for me to work my way up through the\nranks to sushi  i started at the very bottom in the dish pit  this consisted of me washing all dishes  pots  pans  and silverware  i was also required\nto prep meats and veggies  having started at the dish prep position  these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife\nskills as well  i then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work  but also cooking and frying all orders  prep\nconsisted of cutting chicken  beef  shrimp  squid  and all types of veggies  i have been doing sushi now for 3 years  that is  monday saturday 10 \n10  give or take a few hours  i have had random days off here and there and some holidays  but for the most part 12 hours a day  6 days a week \ni have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person s face when they bite into the food and love it  i love being in an\nenvironment conducive for success and working hard while loving what i do  being a sushi chef at sushi time consists of a wide range of tasks \ni ve received serve safe managerial training  so i am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code  i m also in charge of going over\ninventory  ranging from paper plastics  to all meats and veggies  also drinks and alcohol  this task also means i must handle all ordering trough the\ndifferent distributors and vendors we may use  my job requires me on a daily basis to  cook and marinate rice  cut and prepare fish for the day \nmaking sushi rolls  nigiri  sashimi  platters etc  im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may\nhave  over the course of the 6 years i have
