creation of new applications \nprojects  atlas  description  this project is all about requesting  scheduling the tutoring sessions \nthere are three roles tied to application they are tutee  tutor  and scheduler \na tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through availability grid and\ntutor submits availability \na scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring \nalso  there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project \nthe other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day \nresponsibilities  created a availability calendar grid \nin grid each cell represents time  1 hour span  and day of the week \nclicking on the cell toggles the availability \nautomatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database worked with data warehouse team in order to get that\ndata  developed c  console application for scheduled email task \ngot rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled \ncreated class libraries out of
